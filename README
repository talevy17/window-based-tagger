General information:
	All of the following parts are dependent on having a directory 
	called "Data" in it's root which containes the "ner" and "pos" directories
	of the given dataset in the assignment and a directory called 
	"pretrained" that contained two files: "embeddings.txt" and "words.txt"
	which include the word embeddings and the vocabulary respectively. 

Part 1:
	To run simply type pyhton3 tagger1.py in the console,
	It's default is to run on the "pos" dataset, but you can specify
	on which dataset to run by giving pos or ner as a parameter.
	E.g: pyhton3 tagger1.py ner

	Dependencies: tagger1.py, Model.py, ModelTrainer.py and DataUtils.py

Part 2:
	To run simply type python3 top_k.py in the console.

	Dependecies: top_k.py, DataUtils.py

Part 3:
	To run follow the instructions for Part 1, only instead of tagger1
	call tagger2.

	Dependecies: tagger2.py, Model.py, ModelTrainer.py and DataUtils.py

Part 4:
	to run type python3 tagger3.py in the console.
	it's default is running on the "pos" dataset and not using
	the pre trained word embeddings.
	in order to change these settings you can pass "pos" or "ner"
	for the dataset and\or "normal" or "pre_trained" for choosing 
	between the pre_trained embeddings or the "normal" (initilalized 
	uniformily) embeddings.
	The order of the parameters does not matter.
	E.g: python3 tagger3.py pre_trained pos
	     python3 tagger3.py ner normal
	     etc.

	Dependencies: tagger3.py, ModelTrainer.py, DataUtils.py
